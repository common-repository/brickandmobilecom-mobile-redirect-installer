== Frequently Asked Questions ==

**What do I need this plugin for?**

This plugin will detect mobile traffic coming to your Wordpress site, and automatically redirect them to your brick&mobile Premium Mobile Website.

**Should I use HTML/JavaScript or PHP?**

HTML/JavaScript is preferred, but it depends on the theme you have installed. Certain Wordpress themes work better with PHP redirect scripts. Choose PHP if HTML/JavaScript is not working for you.

**Where will this script direct users to?**

The script will redirect users to the mobile website that you generated the mobile redirect script for. Be careful only to use the mobile redirect script generated in the brick&mobile Mobile CMS for the same website, as every redirect script is unique.

**What kind of devices will be redirected?**

Only mobile phone browsers will be redirected to your mobile website. This includes iPhone, BlackBerry, Android and Windows Phone devices. Currently iPad and tablet devices are not handled by the detection code.
